<h1>This is my article title here.</h1>
<p>This is my first paragraph. It's marked off using the p tag.</p>

<p>Here's a second paragraph, although its a single sentence...</p>
<p>I can make text <i>italicized</i>, <b>bolded</b>, or <s>struck-out</s> as needed by just using html markup.</p>
<p><img href="some image path" description="An image is placed here."></p>
<!-- you can include comments as well to, for example, outline what you want your article to cover -->
<p>In the end, just some simple HTML tags are all that is needed to create your article. The rest of the HTML document structure will be built automatically for you.<br>This simplifies things a bit, at least for me.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
